# Export outputs
This part of the code creates derived (aggregated and pivoted where needed) outputs from last section on:
- Emissions
- Cost: CAPEX / OPEX
- Inputs used
- Regions
- Technologies

And makes plots of the availabilities of resources that are used.

Next: [`Merge outputs`](https://github.com/systemiqofficial/chemicals-decarbonization/blob/main/docs/7_merge_outputs.md)
