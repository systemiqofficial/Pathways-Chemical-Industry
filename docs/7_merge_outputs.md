# Merge outputs
This last part of the code aims to integrate outputs across different pathways and sensitivities, and present them in an easier to digest format. The resulting outputs are in `outputs/final/<MODEL_SCOPE>/Aggregated`:
- Technology wedge charts in png and html for all chemicals
- Aggregated cost, demand, emission, input, region outputs
- A dashboard combining data created in `merge_outputs` for the different pathways and sensitivities
